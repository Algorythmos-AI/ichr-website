## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Continuous integration on every pull request: type-check, `astro check`, unit tests on
  Node 22 and 24, and a production build.
- Security scanning: gitleaks (working tree on every change, full history weekly), CodeQL,
  actionlint, and a dependency audit with a reviewed allowlist.
- Pull request hygiene: Conventional Commit titles; production only accepts the trunk.
- Dependabot for npm and GitHub Actions, targeting `integration`.
- Repository policy: code owners, pull request and issue templates, security policy.
- ESLint (TypeScript, Astro, React hooks, jsx-a11y) and Prettier, enforced in CI by a `lint`
  job; `npm run verify` runs the full CI set locally.

### Changed

- Repository moved to `Algorythmos-AI/ichr-website`; `integration` is the default branch and
  `main` is production.

### Fixed

- Admin API client: responses are typed per endpoint instead of `any`.
- World map: the marker registry is captured for effect cleanup.
- Share buttons: modern variable declarations in the copy-link script.

### Security

- Non-breaking dependency updates applied (`npm audit fix`), clearing the `tar`, `js-yaml`,
  `nanoid`, `postcss`, `brace-expansion`, `smol-toml`, `svgo` and `browserslist` advisories.
